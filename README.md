## Future Work

While this study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of various regression models for commodity price prediction, there are several avenues for future research and development to enhance the scope and accuracy of the predictions:

    - Incorporation of More Advanced Models: Future work can explore the inclusion of more advanced machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and deep learning techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series prediction.
    - Feature Engineering and Selection: Further research can focus on advanced feature engineering and selection methods to improve model performance, including the use of domain-specific features, interaction terms, and non-linear transformations.
    - Integration of Exogenous Factors: Including external factors such as weather conditions, political events, and global economic indicators could enhance the robustness of the models.
    - Real-time Prediction Systems: Developing real-time prediction systems and APIs that continuously update and provide price forecasts can have practical implications for stakeholders.
    - Multi-commodity Prediction Models: Extending the models to handle predictions for multiple commodities simultaneously could provide a holistic tool for market analysts and policymakers.
    - Geospatial Analysis: Integrating geospatial data to account for regional variations in commodity prices could provide more localized and accurate predictions.
    - Comparative Studies Across Regions: Expanding the study to include comparative analyses of commodity price prediction models in different countries or regions to understand regional economic behaviors and trends.
    - Policy Impact Assessment: Evaluating how improved prediction models influence policy decisions and market strategies in real-world scenarios.
